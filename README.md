# Lights Out

**Lights Out** is a first-person survival horror game built in Unity 3D. The game takes place inside a dark, eerie house where the player must find a way to restore power by activating a generator locked in the basement. However, the basement door is locked, and the key is hidden somewhere in the house. As the player searches for the key, a terrifying monster or ghost hunts them relentlessly, creating an intense and suspenseful experience.
